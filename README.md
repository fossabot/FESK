[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FEntframe%2FFESK.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FEntframe%2FFESK?ref=badge_shield)


sudo mkdir -p /etc/fesk/custom

# Clone our repo

git clone https://github.com/Entframe/FESK.git && cd FESK

# If your system running by systemd
sudo install -Dm644 systemd/fesk.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/fesk.service
sudo install -m 755 firewall /etc/fesk/firewall

# If your system running by sysvinit
sudo install -m 755 firewall /etc/fesk/firewall
# Create symlink to init.d directory
sudo ln /etc/fesk/firewall /etc/init.d/fesk

# Copy rules
sudo cp etc/fesk/*.conf /etc/fesk/

# Reload rules

# For systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# For sysvinit
sudo update-rc.d firewall defaults
```

Configuration
------------
All configuration-files are located in `/etc/fesk` directory

Feel free to edit the firewall-script itself and comment/uncomment what you like/dislike.

### firewall.conf
Main firewall configfile. All settings are on sane defaults, you really must know what you doing.

### services.conf
This file is used to open ports for services like ssh or http(s) in your firewall.

### ip-whitelist.conf
Add all source IPs you want to have full access to this host. One IP per line

### ip-blacklist.conf
Same as whitelist.

Add all source IPs you want to COMPLETELY BLOCK
One IP per line

### custom-rules
Every file/script you place here will be executed during firewall-start.
Place your custom rules in here.

There are some usefull examples in ./custom-examples/ that limit the ammount of new and overall connections.

### SYNTAX

PORT/PROTOCOLL SOURCE
where SOURCE is the source ip or network

n.n.n.n/m - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m is the bitmask.

if SOURCE is empty it defaults to 0.0.0.0/0 (which is any IP)

### Examples:

opens ports for SSH for IP 192.168.0.1:
```
    22/tcp 192.168.0.1
    22/udp 192.168.0.1
```
opens ports for HTTP for any IP
```
    80/tcp 0.0.0.0/0
```
opens ports for HTTPS for any IP
```
    443/tcp
```

Usage
------------

#### For sysvinit
```
    /etc/init.d/firewall (start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status)
```

#### For systemd
```
    systemctl (start|stop|restart) fesk

    # To get status you shall execute main buildscripts
    /etc/fesk/firewall status
```

* start: starts the firewall
* stop: stops the firewall
* restart, reload, force-reload: restarts the firewall (all three the same)
* status: print out the status of the firewall, shows all entries in iptables

FESK-Utils
------------
I've written Python script for managing updates and checking firewall status

They located in `fesk-utils` directory. 

You need to install these modules: `shutil, argparse, subprocess`

Credits
------------
We used @bmaeser's iptables-boilerplace as base. And this project isn't a fork, we decided to make another for searching proposes
